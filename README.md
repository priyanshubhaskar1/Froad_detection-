**Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning**

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions using multiple machine learning models. It includes complete steps from data preprocessing to model evaluation, providing a practical and educational example of fraud analytics.

📝 **Project Description**

This project focuses on building a Fraud Detection System using Machine Learning by analyzing transactional data and identifying patterns associated with fraudulent activities. The dataset used in this project contains fictitious, non-real financial data created purely for educational and testing purposes. It does not represent real-world individuals or actual financial transactions.

The purpose of creating this dataset is to provide a safe and realistic environment for developing, training, and evaluating fraud detection algorithms without relying on sensitive or private real-world data. This allows students, researchers, and practitioners to explore data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning model development responsibly.

Multiple machine learning models — including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Decision Trees — are trained and compared to identify the most effective approach for fraud classification. The project includes full steps such as data cleaning, visualization, model evaluation, and performance comparison using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.
